        <h2>Some background information</h2>
        <p>I’m an <strong>aspiring web designer</strong>.  I spend a lot of my free time doing arts and crafts and one of my Treehouse goals is to create a website that features my work. My crafting specialties are <em>needle felting, print making, preserved floral wall hangings, and jewelry design</em>. I first became interested in web design while I was working as a studio designer for a company called Planted Design, and my interest in web development has been growing ever since. </p>
        <p>It's safe to say 2020 was not the best year for a lot of people.  I lost my job due in large part to the Covid pandemic; but that also gave me the opportunity to sign up for Treehouse.</p>

        <h2>My goals at Treehouse</h2>
        <p>I want to be able to create a website to promote and sell my crafts. I would also like to feel comfortable enough with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I can start an online portfolio in hopes of landing a great job in the future.</p>
